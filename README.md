I belive this is  a GL port for Heretic. Im just going off what I find on the source page.

There is a little glitches from what i see when the demo plays. i dont know if that is the demo or what. the light i have played it seems ok for me 


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exarkuniv/Hheretic-RPi/Master/hheretic.sh -P $HOME/RetroPie-Setup/scriptmodules/ports/
